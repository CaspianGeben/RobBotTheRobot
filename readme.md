## But.. where is my classroom?



This is a Discord bot-project for my college classmates. I thought it could be a cool feature to have a bot tell us all in the class server where we're supposed to be, every morning or every night before. Haven't really decided yet. 



The idea is to parse a subscribed calendar and get the name of the classroom and the time of class, then give us this data in the server.
