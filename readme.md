## Rob Bot



The Rob Bot project is a chat bot, specifically written to be of assistance for me and my college mates.

The initial purpose was to inform us in the chat every morning which classroom we were seated in for the day. However this quickly opened up my eyes as to just how much the bot could actually do for us. Reminders, automatic messages on schedule, scraping the lunch menu site, Google Custom Search integration etcetera. 

The project has now grown in to a full-blown assistant for our class and it keeps on growing. Want to contribute?
